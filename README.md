# Tomasulo Algorithm Project

## Introduction 

This is an implementation of the Tomasulo Algorithm made by the students Felipe Guimarães, Felipe Uchida, Lucas Jorge e Dennys Rocha,
from ITA (Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica). This project was made for the [CES-25 subject (Computer Archteture)](http://www.comp.ita.br/~pauloac/ces25/index.html), taugth by the 
professor [Paulo André](http://www.comp.ita.br/~pauloac/).
